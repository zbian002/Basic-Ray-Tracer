PROJECT: RAY TRACER

I. COMPILING:

Use 'make' command to compile both of the executables: ray_tracer, ray_tracer_preview
If opengl is not available, use 'make ray_tracer' to compile only the version without opengl viewer.

II. RUNNING:

Two different version of the program is available:
  ray_tracer: This is the program that the grading script uses, this generates a output.png and diff.png files if the solution file is available
  ray_tracer_preview: Same as ray_tracer, but it displays the rendered image (and the solution next to it, if available) in an opengl context.

  To run a test:
    ./ray_tracer -i <test_filename>  #OR
    ./ray_tracer_preview -i <test_filename>
  e.g.
    ./ray_tracer_preview -i ./tests/00.txt

III. GRADING

The grading script goes through all tests in a given folder and provides you with a score. 
To see your score, run the grading script by:
  ./grading-script.py ./tests/

Make sure to test your code with the grading script on delta or lab machines before submitting!

Good luck, have fun!
